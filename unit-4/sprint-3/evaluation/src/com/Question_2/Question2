Q2 Briefly explain the difference between Early and Late Binding with examples.

Early Binding :---
1. Early binding happens at compile-time.
2. Method definition and method call is linked during compile-time.
3. Also known as Static binding.
4. Execution speed is faster.

Example :---

1. Normal method call.
2. Overloaded Method.

Late Binding  :---
1. Late binding happens at run-time.
2. Flexible because single method can handle different objects at run time.
3. Also known as Dynamic binding.
4. Execution speed is lower.

Example:---
1. Method Overriding;
