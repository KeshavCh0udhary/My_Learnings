Q4) Explain the difference between overloading and overriding methods with an example?

Ans4)
overloading                                         overriding
=============                                      =============
When two or more methods in the same class     When the method signature (name and parameters) 
 have the same name but different parameters,  are the same in the superclass and the child class
it’s called Overloading.						it’s called Overriding.

Overloading occurs between the methods in the  method Overriding occurs between superclass and 
same class.										subclass.


Example Overriding
==================
class Vehicle{  
  //defining a method  
  void run(){
  	System.out.println("Vehicle is running");
  }  
}  
//Creating a child class  
class Bike2 extends Vehicle{  
  //defining the same method as in the parent class  
  void run(){
  	System.out.println("Bike is running safely");
  }  
  
  public static void main(String args[]){  
  	Bike2 obj = new Bike2();//creating object  
  	obj.run();//calling method  
  }  
}  

OUTPUT
======
Bike is running safely
