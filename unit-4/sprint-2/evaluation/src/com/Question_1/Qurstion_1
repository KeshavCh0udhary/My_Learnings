Q1) a) Why String is immutable in java and what is the difference between String and String Builder?
 And Write some of the methods of String class at least 5 with example.
 
 Answer :- In Java the strings are immutable it means that we can't change the Object itself, but we
 can change the reference of the object.
 
 Example --> String Str = "Krishna Keshav";
 
 Str.concat("Choudhary");
 
 System.out.print(Str);
 
 It will give us Krishna Keshav ;
 
 But If we write String Str1=Str;
 
 And we are trying to print  System.out.println(Str1);
  then it will give Krishna Keshav
  
  Here--> (String Str1=Str)--> In Str1 the address of the Str is stored and when we are trying to print 
  the value of Str1 it refers to the address of the Str and it prints the value (Krishna Keshav);
  
  
  
  Difference between String and String Builder------
  
   String :- 
   
  1. It performs Slow as compared to StringBuilder during frequent updates and concataning.
  2. The String created using String class is immutable.
  3. It requires more memory to create a new instance if operations performed on a string change its value.
  4. An object of string is read-only in nature.
  
   StringBuilder :- 
   
  1. StringBuilder is fast as compare to String.
  2. The String created using String class is mutable.
  3. It requires less memory as it updates the existing instance.
  4. An object of StringBuilder is dynamic in nature.
  
  
  
  Methods of String class---------
  
  1. Char charAt(int i);
  
  Example :-  String Str="Krishna Keshav";
  System.out.println(Str.charAt(0)); -->It will give the charecter at 0 position.
  
  2. int length();
  
  Example :- String Str="Krishna Keshav";
  System.out.println(Str.length()); --> It will give the length of the string.
  
  3. String concat(String args);
  Example :- String Str="Krishna Keshav";
  String newStr2=Str.concat(" Choudhary");
  System.out.println(newStr2); -->It will give the new concated string Krishna Keshav Choudhary;
  
  4. boolean equals(Object args);
  Example :- String Str="Krishna Keshav";
  System.out.println(Str.equals("K"));--> It will give false;
  5. String substring(int i);
  Example :- String Str="Krishna Keshav";
  System.out.println(Str.substring(0)); --->It will give Krishna;
  
  
  
b) What is the difference between equals method and == operator in java? And what will be the output of the
following code snippets and giving proper explanation.

Answer :- 

equals() Method should be used for content comparision;
equals() Method evaluates the content to check the equality;
equals() is a method of Object class.
equals() It can be overide if the present. 

== should be used during refernce comparision.
== checks if both reference points to same location or not.
== is an operator.
== can't be overriden.



String s1 = new String("abc");
String s2 = new String("abc");
System.out.println(s1.equals(s2));
 
 Output :- true;
 Explanation :- Here equals method compares whole arguments means we are comparing whole value of s1 and s2.
 
 
StringBuilder sb1 = new StringBuilder("abc");
StringBuilder sb2 = new StringBuilder("abc");
System.out.println(sb1.equals(sb2));

Output :- false;
Explanation :- Here both sb1 and sb2 are created with new StringBuilder so it can't compare the object.
   
String s1 = new String("abc");
String s2 = new String("abc");
System.out.println(s1==s2);

false; 

Explanation :- Here both s1 and s2 are created using new keyword so the address of both string is different and 
== compares the address so it will give false.
