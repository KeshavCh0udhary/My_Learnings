Q1)  Is there any difference between creating a string with and without a new operator?  
     Explain with an example.

Ans :- String Str1 = new String("MyString");

     1. Always create a new object on the heap.

     2. Here creates a new String having for value the value of the constant "MyString" and assigns its
        reference to the variable Str1.
       
     3. Here 2 object is created.  
     
       
       
       
       String Str2 = "MyString";
       
     1. Here assigns the reference associated to the constant "MyString" to the variable Str2.
     
     2. Here one object is created.
     
     3. This uses the String pool
