Q3) Explain the difference between equals() and HashCode() Method.

Answer :- 
equals() method :---
equals() checks if the two object references are same. If two objects are equal then their hashCode must be the 
same, but the reverse is not true.


HashCode() Method :---
The value returned by hashCode() is the object's hash code, which is the object's memory address in hexadecimal.
