Q1) The set of positive numbers starting from 1 is known as Natural Numbers. The sum of
the first N natural numbers is given by the formula [N * (N + 1)] / 2 For example, given a
number 5, the sum of the first 5 natural numbers will be[5 * (6)]/2 = 15
● Write a Java class with a static method that will take a number as a parameter, and print the
sum of the natural number from 1 to the number supplied as the method argument.
● Call the above-defined method from the main method of that class by supplying any number
as an argument and print the result.

Q2) The prime factors of a number are all of the integers below that number that are
divisible into the number as well as 1. For example, the prime factors of 12 are 1,2,3,4,6,
and 12.
● Write a Java class with a static method that will take a number and print all the prime factorial
of that number.
● The Supplied number should be between 2 and 100. otherwise, it should print “Invalid
number”.
● Call this method from the main method by supplying any valid argument.

Q3) Define Wrapper Classes in Java.

Ans : A Wrapper class is a class whose object wraps or contains primitive data types. When we create an
object to a wrapper class, it contains a field and in this field, we can store primitive data types. In
other words, we can wrap a primitive value into a wrapper class object.


Q4) Explain why the following block of code will give a compile time error?
public class Main {
public static void main(String[] args) {
float f=3.3;
System.out.println(f);
}
}
Also rectify this code.

Ans : In this code if we want to  print floot value then we have to do either down casting or 
we cal use by default property double.

Example :- 
//First way to print float value...
public class Main {
public static void main(String[] args) {
float f=3.3f; <---//float f=3.3;
System.out.println(f);
}
}

//Another way to print float value...
public class Main {
public static void main(String[] args) {
double f=3.3; <---//float f=3.3;
System.out.println(f);
}
}
