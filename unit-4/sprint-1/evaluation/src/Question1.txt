Q; Explain why Java is platform independent ?
Answer;  Java Compiler produce a unique type of code called by byte code unlike c compiler where compiler produces only natively execuatable code 
for a particular machine.
When the Java program runs in a particular machine it is sent to java compiler, which converts this code into intermediate code called byte code.
This byte code is sent to java virtual machine which resides in the RAM of any operating system. JVM recognizes the platform it is on and converts 
the byte codes into native machine code. Hence java is called platform independent language.
