Q2) Explain the difference between Checked and Unchecked exceptions. write some
examples of checked and unchecked exception classes.

==============================================================================
Ans-->
  
  exception is an unwanted or unexpected event, which occurs during the execution of the program, i.e. at run time, that disrupts 
    the normal flow of the program's instructions.In java, there are two types of exception:
 1. checked exception
 2.unchecked exception
  

 checked exception -->
    
  These are the exceptions that are checked at compile time. If some code within a method throws a checked exception, then the
  method must either handle the exception or it must specify the exception using the throws keyword. In checked exception, there are
  two types: fully checked and partially checked exceptions. A fully checked exception is a checked exception where all its child 
 classes are also checked, like IOException, InterruptedException. A partially checked exception is a checked exception where some of
 its child classes are unchecked, like Exception.
   
Example--> IOException, InterruptedException,ClassNotFoundException



 Unchecked Exception --->

  These are the exceptions that are not checked at compile time. In C++, all exceptions are unchecked, so it is not forced by the
 compiler to either handle or specify the exception. It is up to the programmers to be civilized, and specify or catch the exceptions.
 In Java, exceptions under Error and RuntimeException classes are unchecked exceptions, everything else under throwable is checked. 

Example-->NullpointerException,ArrayOutOfBoundexception,NumberFormatexceptiom.
