: Explain difference between PriorityQueue() and LinkedList();

Ans ;-

PriorityQueue()----

PriorityQueue is an unbounded priority queue based on a priority heap. The elements of the priority queue are ordered according to their natural ordering,
or by a Comparator provided at queue construction time, depending on which constructor is used. A priority queue does not permit null elements. 


LinkedList()---

java.util.LinkedList is a doubly-linked list implementation of the List and Dequeue interfaces. Implements all optional list operations, 
and permits all elements (including null).
