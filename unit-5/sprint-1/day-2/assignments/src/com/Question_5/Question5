 Explain Difference between Upper Bounded Wildcards and Lower Bounded Wildcards with Example.
 
 Ans :- 

Upper Bounded Wildcards:-- 

The purpose of upper bounded wildcards is to decrease the restrictions on a variable. It
restricts the unknown type to be a specific type or a subtype of that type. It is used by
declaring wildcard character ("?") followed by the extends (in case of, class) or
implements (in case of, interface) keyword, followed by its upper bound.



Lower Bounded Wildcards :--

The purpose of lower bounded wildcards is to restrict the unknown type to be a specific
type or a supertype of that type. It is used by declaring wildcard character ("?") followed
by the super keyword, followed by its lower bound.
