Question 1:
What are the advantages of using Hibernate over JDBC?

Ans : - The advantages of Hibernate over JDBC are:

1. Hibernate code will work well for all databases, 
example :-  Oracle , MySQL etc. where as JDBC is database specific.

2. No knowledge of SQL is needed because Hibernate is a set of objects and a table is treated as an object, where as to work with JDBC, one need to know SQL.

3. Query tuning is not required in Hibernate. The query tuning is automatic in hibernate by using criteria queries, and the result of performance is at its best. 
   Where as in JDBC the query tuning is to be done by the database authors.

4. With the support of cache of hibernate, the data can be placed in the cache for better performance. Where as in JDBC the java cache is to be implemented.
