Q3/- What are the challenges of developing an Enterprise application?

Ans-->>>>>>>


--An Enterprise application is bydefault a distributed application, 
because EA is divided into seperate modules, and each module can be a independent
application, here each module will collaborate with each other and provide services
as whole.

1. data security : the data exchange should be encrypted and decripted, authentication and
           authorization is also required.

2. client can access the application in a platform and language independent form.
i.e by making our presentation logic web-enabled. so client can access our application
through the web-browser.

Presentation could be in GUI : that can be accessed by the browser (webapplication)
they are not reusable.

Presentation could be in the form raw data (JSON or xml format)  (webservices)
they are the reusable
