Q4/- What is auto wiring in Spring, how many types of Auto wiring are there in spring,
explain with an example.


The process of creating association between/among application components is known as "wiring".(variable is
wired with appropriate object)
We have 2 kind of wiring in spring application:
1. Explicit wiring
2. Auto-wiring (implicit wiring)
If a spring developer specifies the associations for the dependency bean by <property> tag or <constructorarg> tag, it is known as explicit wiring.
Whereas if spring container on its own detects the dependencies implicitly and injecting them into the
dependent bean is known as "auto-wiring".
To instruct the spring container to perform auto-wiring for a particular bean, we make use of the "autowire"
attribute inside the <bean> tag with any one of following values:
1. no (default)
2. byName
3. byType
4. constructor
 In bean auto-wiring, spring container automatically injects a bean dependencies by either calling a setter
method or calling parameterized constructor without writing explicitly inside the
spring configuration file.
