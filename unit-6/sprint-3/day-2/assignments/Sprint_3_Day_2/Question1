What is Spring bean?
Spring Bean: is an object, which is created, managed and destroyed in Spring Container.
 We can inject an object into the Spring Container through the metadata(either xml or annotation),
  which is called inversion of control.
  
spring container-->
The Spring container is at the core of the Spring Framework. The container will create the objects,
 wire them together, configure them, and manage their complete life cycle from creation till 
 destruction. The Spring container uses DI to manage the components that make up an application.
 
 we have multiple ways to activate our spring container in our application like by creating xml files
 in resources folder or we also can activate our spring container using some annotation as well.By 
 using xml file we define the dependencies using some tags and by defining the some setter method and 
 constructor inside the java class.
